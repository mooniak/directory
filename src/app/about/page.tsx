          With a global view and local roots, Mooniak specializes in producing
          multi-script fonts and typography for Lankan audiences in Sinhala,
          Tamil, and English languages. In addition to incubating and releasing
          open-source fonts, we also provide custom typeface design, logotype
          design, lettering, and editorial design services for select clients.
          Almost all of Mooniak's work is published under Libre/Open source
          licenses. We take pride in building a thriving community of letterform
          lovers in Sri Lanka, and with a small team of full-timers and
          collaborators from all around the world, we are advancing the Lankan
          visual identity.

            In its first decade Mooniak was a point of collaboration which
            launched many projects. Mooniak has been operating as a collective
            of creatives focusing on community impact design projects since
            2010. While the team consists of a multidisciplinary team, our
            primary focus is on typography and type design projects and
            providing services to commercial entities to enable effective
            communications in all three official languages of Sri Lanka.
            <br /> <br />
            In 2015 Mooniak received funds from Google to produce a set of
            Sinhala, Tamil and Latin fonts and was subsequently incorporated as
            a private limited company in Sri Lanka. In 2015â€“2016 Mooniak
            exclusively worked on producing the first ever web font families to
            support Sinhala, Tamil and Latin scripts enabling better
            communications in Sinhala, Tamil and English. Mooniak developed and
            released tools, workflows and research relating to the projects
            under open licenses making it one of the biggest open culture
            projects in Sri Lanka.
            <br />
            <br />
            Since 2016 Mooniak has focused on editorial design projects and
            introduced building awareness in multilingual typography among the
            Sri Lanka community and has focused on knowledge exchange projects.
            The design studio works on selected commercial projects, mostly
            focusing on CSR related projects. Mooniak takes pride in
            participating in a number of international design projects, such as
            designing for International Unicode Consortium, MICT international
            and consulting on a number of international type design projects.
